                    Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as Tottenham 
                    or Spurs, is an English professional football club based in 
                    Tottenham, London. It competes in the Premier League, the top flight of 
                    English football. The team has played its home matches in the 62,850-capacity 
                    Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since April 2019, replacing their former home of 
                    White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new 
                    stadium on the same site.

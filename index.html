            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's 
            dominant software platform. It is an information space where 
            documents and other web resources can be accessed through the Internet 
            using a web browser. The Web has changed people's lives immeasurably. 
            It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact 
            on the Internet. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 
            and opened to the public in 1991.
